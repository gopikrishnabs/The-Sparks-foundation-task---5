This is my  2nd task as an Data science and business analytics intern. This task demonstrates few EDA processes.


EDA
It is an important step for every data science project.
It does all the preprocessing work before using for patterns extraction process.
High quality data is rear so, EDA is must.
One can see the patterns which will help in deciding which model to choose, which technique to apply, etc...
Once the inferences are made then the data will be classified as useful or not useful.
